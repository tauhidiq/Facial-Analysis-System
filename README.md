The facial analysis system was developed by the KHU Image Processing Team, including Byungyong Ryu, Md. Tauhid Bin Iqbal, Farkhod Makhmudkhujaev, Gihun Song, and others. The project utilizes traditional local image descriptors such as LBP, LDP, LDNP, PTP, and NEDP, along with classical classifiers like SVM and KNN, to perform various tasks including facial expression recognition, and age and gender classification.
